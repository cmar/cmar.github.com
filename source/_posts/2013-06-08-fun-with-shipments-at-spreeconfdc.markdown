I opened SpreeConfDC with a talk on the current state of the Spree community and a discussion of the new Split Shipments in Spree 2.0. I'm really proud of the design and hard work the core team put into building this powerful feature.

Split Shipments was designed to help store owners of all sizes. The default behavior will be familiar to long time Spree users. But underneath lies a powerful set of constructs to help your store grow from a single location to a world wide enterprise.

This post gathers the video and slides for my talk. Thanks to
