There is a new theme in town. Move over solarized. Make room for Hemisu.
This has become my new vim and terminal theme for daily coding. I tried
to use solarized; but I couldn't fall in love.

Noah Frederick has created this amazing theme for Vim and Mac Terminal.
It includes light and dark variations. I prefer the dark background unless
I get stuck by the window at Starbucks. Then it is a simple "set background=light".
