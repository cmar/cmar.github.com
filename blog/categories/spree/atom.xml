    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I opened SpreeConfDC with a talk on the current state of the Spree community and a discussion of the new Split Shipments in Spree 2.0. I'm really proud of the design and hard work the core team put into building this powerful feature.</p>

<p>Split Shipments was designed to help store owners of all sizes. The default behavior will be familiar to long time Spree users. But underneath lies a powerful set of constructs to help your store grow from a single location to a world wide enterprise.</p>

<p>This post gathers the video and slides for my talk. Thanks to
<a href="http://twitter.com/nate_edwards80">Nate Edwards</a> who recorded my talk and published it in 2 parts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have removed Product Groups from the core Spree project. This was a rarely used feature; but, the code was fairly complex. In an effort to keep Spree lean, the code was extracted and moved to an <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree_product_groups">extension</a>.</p>

<p>The commit to <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/b0e1b664f4dc87efeb54333e4cfe7802d0d9ebfc">Spree Master</a> will be part of the 1.1 release. If you are using Product Group functionality, then you'll want to include the extension in your Gemfile after 'spree'.</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem 'spree'
gem 'spree_product_groups', :git =&gt; 'git@github.com:spree/spree_product_groups.git'
</code></p>

<p>It has not been released as a gem, so you'll have to declare it with a reference to the git repository.</p>

<p>All previous Product Group functionality will be restored by the extension.</p>
